# E11b-First-Person

This is really fun!
It is great to know more about creating an actual character!



This is an opportunity to begin to experiment with a first-person perspective in a Godot 3D environment. This exercise will involve creating collision shapes to represent the player's body and then controlling the camera with the keyboard and mouse.

First, **fork and clone** this repository. Then, open Godot and Import a project. Find the location of this repository in the Godot file picker and then open the project.godot file.

Again, the KidsCanCode tutorial should guide you step-by-step through this exercise. There is also a video that accompanies the tutorial. The only change from the video should be that you will navigate the terrain I have provided instead of the CSG environment he describes.

 When you are invited to download the Kenney Weapon Pack, you can do so here: [https://kenney.nl/assets/weapon-pack](https://kenney.nl/assets/weapon-pack).
 
 When you have completed the exercise, save the Scenes, edit your LICENSE and README, commit everything to Github, and turn in the URL of your repository on Canvas.
